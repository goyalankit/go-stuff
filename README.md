- `epoll`: demonstrates usage of epoll syscalls. This program implements an epoll based connection handling.

- `ns`: demonstrates usage of setns syscall. This program demonstrates how a process can be created in a new
namespace and how an existing process can join some but not all the namespaces.

- `gogob`: demonstrates usage of gob package and how it can be used to communicate between two go processes.

- `3pc`: work in progress. This is an implementation of 3pc protocol built upon the ideas of other programs
in this repo.
